In this data set it's easy because there's one, and only one value that matches. But you'd need to do some clever thinking about how to handle ties.\n",
    "2. `np.where` returns a complex data structure (list-of-lists, essentially) so we need to pull the value we need out of that data in order to actually find the list index we need and look up the `City` name associated with, for example, the minium value in the data. That bit (`[0][0]`) is a bit clunky, but right now we're not too worried about it.\n",
